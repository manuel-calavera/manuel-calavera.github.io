                <h3 class="h3">Proof of History: The Key to Speed</h3>
                <p class="text">Similar to Google’s TrueTime, which relies on synchronized atomic clocks for a trusted source of time and ordering, Solana has created a cryptographically secure and trustless time source — and built a blockchain around it. We call it Proof of History.</p>
                <p class="text">By weaving this standardized timestamp into the blockchain, nodes in the network can verify the time and order of events without witnessing them directly. This drastically reduces messaging overhead and is one example of the many optimization capabilities that become available through Solana’s Proof of History.</p>

              <div class="right">
                <h3 class="h3">Sub-second finality that actually scales</h3>
                <p class="text">Decentralized blockchain solutions have a scaling problem. In addition to low transaction rates, maintaining quick finality while the network scales is a major problem and many current solutions compromise decentralisation.</p>
                <p class="text">Through Solana’s “Avalanche” network communication innovation, finality times reduce exponentially as the network grows. This means we can expect ~500ms finality up through 10s of thousands of nodes and beyond.</p>

              <div class="right">
                <h3 class="h3">Finally, scaling without sharding</h3>
                <p class="text">Solana’s approach takes existing blockchain architecture and algorithms and improves on them instead of overlaying additional complexities such as sharding which can compromise security. We believe the right solution is a simple solution.</p>

              <div class="right">
                <h3 class="h3">Scalable smart contracts in any language</h3>
                <p class="text">The development community is our top priority. We intend to be the go-to network for developers who want to build decentralised applications of any kind. With Solana, you can write smart contracts in almost any language. We leverage Berkeley Packet Filter, allowing any language that LLVM supports to be utilized.</p>
                <p class="text">In addition, the smart contracts engine runs on GPUs. The future is massively parallel, and GPU cores are doubling every 2 years. Today a 5 thousand dollar machine will simultaneously execute 14,000 smart contracts. In two years 28,000. This is why in 10 years solana will be the first blockchain to process a billion transactions per second.</p>

              <div class="feature__desc">Imagine a decentralized trading system that never touches user's private keys. The entire order book is securely included in the blockchain replicated state while retaining all the performance characteristics of Nasdaq. At 710k tps, Solana can fit Nasdaq's volumes with room to spare. We enable this using atomic cross chain transactions combined with tradable swaps.</div>

              <div class="feature__desc">Payments are the holy grail of blockchain, but adoption and scalability are inevitable hurdles. Solana's transaction costs are to be on the order of $0.000001 and lightning fast. Bitcoin's throughput, at 3 payments per day per person, is only enough to service the population of Berkeley, California. We can do better. Solana lays the foundation for the payments platform that blockchain has always promised.</div>

              <div class="feature__desc">The future of cloud storage and web services can be decentralized, encrypted, permissionless, and secure. Decentralized file storage systems have the potential to eliminate high markup and human capital costs, and set new standards of unit economics for distributed data storage. Solana provides a scalable path for this future to become a reality.</div>

              <div class="feature__title">Distributed Ad Exchanges</div>
              <div class="feature__desc">If ads are traded on a single, transparent platform, all sorts of ancillary data-driven industries can sprout up: tracking and measurement, rating, and industry reporting. These business models would require nodes to keep much more extensive ledgers than just day-of transactions. At the same time so we need a highly scalable chain to support this future of ad tech (Google serves up 340,000 ads per second). What distributed solutions are there that can support high speed on-chain data collection? You guessed it, this is where Solana’s high throughput blockchain shines.</div>

                    <div class="faq__title"><span>What’s the TL;DR of the whitepaper?</span></div>
                    <div class="faq__text js-accordion-text">
                      <p>We are building a new blockchain protocol that’s based on encoding passage of time as data. We call this Proof of History (PoH). Solana is creating a trustless, distributed, cryptographic protocol to create a reliable ordering of events, which solves for many of the existing scalability problems that other blockchain protocols face.</p>
                      <p>Our solution is built to make transaction processing independent of consensus. Additionally, this is a high-throughput blockchain that doesn’t rely on shards, partitions, side chains, multi chains, etc. As a result of this new system architecture, Solana’s new PoH blockchain will allow up to 710,000 transactions per second on a 1 gigabit network.</p>

                    <div class="faq__title"><span>What makes this scalable?</span></div>
                    <div class="faq__text js-accordion-text">
                      <p>For many distributed networks, the time to finality (the guarantee that past transactions on a digital ledger are legitimate and will not change) scales as the square or even the cube of the number of nodes in the system. Because of our Proof of History (PoH) implementation and our Avalanche communication design, Solana blockchain’s time to finality scales with the logarithm of the number of nodes. What does this mean? A high throughput network, with tens of thousands of nodes, that retains sub-second finality times.</p>

                  </li>

                    <div class="faq__title"><span>What's Proof of Replication and what is it's role in Solana's blockchain?</span></div>
                    <div class="faq__text js-accordion-text">
                      <p>Proof of Replication (PoRep) is a proof of storage protocol. And in our blockchain, it’s used for increasing availability, making it unnecessary for all nodes in the entire network to store the full ledger. It achieves this by ensuring that each bit of data has been replicated to it’s own uniquely dedicated physical storage node(s). In practical terms, it essentially allows the network to prove that a node you don’t trust is using its resources to store a segment of the ledger. This generates a torrent like network, where no single node is holding the full ledger, but a copy is always available on demand.</p>
                    </div>
                  </li>
                  <li class="faq__item js-accordion-item">
                    <div class="faq__title"><span>What’s Avalanche, and what does it do?</span></div>
                    <div class="faq__text js-accordion-text">
                      <p>Avalanche is a method of organising the network data flow. The generator (leader) is at the top of the pyramid, with validators at each level below it. And for every additional level below the generator, the number of validators doubles.</p>
                      <p>This enables Solana to scale their finality times logarithmically or log(n), where ‘n’ is the number of nodes. Typically, finality times on traditional gossip protocols scale at n squared, which means the finality times suffer exponentially as nodes increase on the network. However with Avalanche, the opposite occurs on Solana, thus supporting greater decentralization of nodes, while maintaining sub-second finality times.</p>

                    <div class="faq__text js-accordion-text">
                      <p>Indeed, Solana was previously known as Loom Protocol. Due to other projects having similar names, the project team decided to change its name to Solana.</p>
                      <p>The name Solana is inspired by a beach town in Northern San Diego county where the CEO and the Co-Founders lived and surfed for 5 years.</p>

                      <p>Solana uses Proof of Stake (PoS) as its consensus mechanism. Solana does innovate on the consensus layer--our approach to better scalability is adding a sense of time to a permissionless network. Read about our PoH protocol here.</p>

                    <div class="faq__text js-accordion-text">
                      <p>Given the high transaction throughput of Solana, which is comparable to the amount of transactions that NASDAQ completes per second, we believe Solana will be capable of powering the next generation of decentralised exchanges, prediction markets, payment platforms, etc. However, that’s not to say that other dApps won’t be suitable for Solana. The aim of the project is to be a dApp platform that can support a broad range of use cases beyond those mentioned above.</p>

                      <p>Our development is in full swing, our whitepaper has been validated by multiple parties, and feedback is always welcome. Join our Telegram or contact us for the latest</p>
                      <p>As of early May, Solana is at single node testnet v0.5.0. We achieved 250,000 transactions per second. This is a 700% increase over the previous version, which was at 35,000 transactions per second. During this version of the testnet we peaked at 400,000 transactions. These results were achievable partly because of Stephen Akridge’s GPU implementation, which enables 870,000 signature verifications per second.</p>
                      <p>The next milestone for the project is to set up a multinode testnet. We expect to share an update in June.</p>

                      <p>We use Cuda, Rust. The primary reason for this is because there is no garbage collector. And the compiler manages memory for you. This is critical because to interface with the GPU we need to access the memory directly without overhead. All the other garbage collection languages typically have high overheads.</p>

                      <p>PoRep is replicating the ledger, not the state (this is the Spool). You still need to pay message fees so you can’t DoS everything, but you can create many accounts with little value in each. We might end up pushing things to disk if they are stale or small.</p>

                    <div class="faq__text js-accordion-text">
                      <p>The smallest packet size as outlined within the whitepaper is made up of the following elements:</p>
                      <p>
                        20 byte (160 bit) last valid hash counter (ripemd of the sha)
                        8 byte counter
                        2 byte flags and payload size
                        20 byte to address (ripemd(sha256(public key)))
                        8 byte amount
                        8 byte fee
                        32 byte public key used to sign
                        64 byte signature
                      </p>
                      <p>The sum of all of that is: 20 + 8 + 2 + 20 + 8 + 8 + 32 + 64 = 162 bytes.</p>
                      <p>In theory, the packet size could be reduced even further by keeping the amounts dynamically sized based on flags and dropping the counters. However, the gains are minimal, and would only serve to increase the format complexity.</p>
